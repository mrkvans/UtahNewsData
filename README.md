# UtahNewsData Swift Package

A comprehensive Swift package for managing news data with support for relational database export and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Overview

UtahNewsData provides a rich set of data models for representing news entities such as articles, people, organizations, events, and more. It includes functionality for:

- Creating and managing relationships between entities
- Exporting data to relational databases
- Preparing data for vector embeddings and RAG systems
- Generating knowledge graphs
- Creating rich context for AI systems

## Installation

Add UtahNewsData to your Swift package dependencies:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/yourusername/UtahNewsData.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

## Core Concepts

### Entity Models

The package includes the following entity models:

### Relationship Model

Entities can be connected through relationships using the `Relationship` struct:

```swift
public struct Relationship: BaseEntity, Codable, Hashable {
    public var id: String                  // Unique identifier for the relationship
    public var name: String                // Name or description of the relationship
    public let targetId: String            // ID of the target entity
    public let type: EntityType            // Type of the target entity
    public var displayName: String?        // Human-readable relationship description
    public let createdAt: Date             // When the relationship was created
    public var context: String?            // Additional context about the relationship
}
```

### RAG Utilities

The package includes utilities for Retrieval-Augmented Generation:

- Context generation for entities and relationships
- Vector record preparation for embedding
- Knowledge graph generation
- Combined context generation for multiple entities

### Data Export

Utilities for exporting data to relational databases:

- SQL statement generation for entities
- SQL statement generation for relationships
- Table schema generation

## Usage Examples

### Creating Entities and Relationships

```swift
// Create entities
let person = Person(
    name: "Jane Doe",
    details: "A reporter",
    occupation: "Journalist"
)

let organization = Organization(
    name: "Utah News Network",
    orgDescription: "A news organization"
)

// Create a relationship
let relationship = Relationship(
    id: organization.id,
    type: .organization,
    displayName: "Works at",
    context: "Jane has been working here since 2020"
)

// Add the relationship to the person
var updatedPerson = person
updatedPerson.relationships.append(relationship)
```

### Generating Context for RAG

```swift
// Generate context for a single entity
let personContext = RAGUtilities.generateEntityContext(updatedPerson)

// Generate context for multiple entities
let combinedContext = RAGUtilities.generateCombinedContext([updatedPerson, organization])
```

### Preparing Data for Vector Embedding

```swift
// Generate vector records for entities
let vectorRecords = RAGUtilities.prepareEntitiesForEmbedding([updatedPerson, organization])
```

### Creating a Knowledge Graph

```swift
// Generate a knowledge graph
let graph = RAGUtilities.generateKnowledgeGraph([updatedPerson, organization])

// Export to JSON
let graphJSON = try graph.toJSON()
```

### Exporting to SQL

```swift
// Generate SQL for an entity
let personSQL = DataExporter.exportEntityToSQL(updatedPerson)

// Generate SQL for relationships
let relationshipSQL = DataExporter.exportRelationshipsToSQL(updatedPerson)
```

## Entity Types

The following entity types are supported in the `AssociatedDataType` enum:

## RAG Example

Here's a complete example of using the RAG utilities:

```swift```
## Model Reference

This package includes the following models:

### JSON Schema Generation

Most models in this package conform to `JSONSchemaProvider`, enabling automatic JSON schema generation for LLM interactions:

```swift
// Example of accessing a model's JSON schema
let schema = StatisticalData.jsonSchema

// Use this schema to instruct LLMs how to generate valid JSON
// for creating or updating StatisticalData instances
```

The JSON schemas define:
- Required and optional properties
- Property types and formats
- Nested object structures
- Array specifications
- Validation rules
## Consolidated Models

For a complete reference of all models, see the `ConsolidatedModels.swift` file which is generated by the `scripts/consolidate_models.sh` script.

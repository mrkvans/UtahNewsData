 # RAG Example
 
 This file provides practical examples of how to use the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
 utilities in the UtahNewsData package. It demonstrates the complete workflow from creating
 entities and relationships to generating context, preparing vector records, creating
 knowledge graphs, and exporting to SQL.
 
 ## Key Demonstrations:
 
 1. Entity Creation: Creating Person and Organization entities
 2. Relationship Establishment: Creating bidirectional relationships between entities
 3. Context Generation: Generating rich text context for RAG systems
 4. Vector Preparation: Preparing entities for vector embedding
 5. Knowledge Graph Creation: Building a graph representation of entities and relationships
 6. SQL Export: Generating SQL statements for relational database storage
 
 ## Usage:
 
 You can call the `prepareEntitiesForRAG()` function to see the complete workflow in action:
 
 ```swift
 RAGExample.prepareEntitiesForRAG()
 ```
 
 This example is designed to be educational and demonstrate best practices for
 working with the UtahNewsData models and RAG utilities.

    /// 3. Generating context for individual entities and combined entities
    /// 4. Preparing vector records for embedding
    /// 5. Creating a knowledge graph
